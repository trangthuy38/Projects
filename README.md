Customer churn rate refers to the percentage of customers or subscribers who discontinue their relationship with a company over a specific period of time. It is a metric commonly used in business to measure customer retention and gauge the effectiveness of customer relationship management strategies.

Churn Rate = (Customers Lost / Total Customers at the Start of the Period) * 100

Monitoring and reducing churn rate is important for businesses as it can be costly to acquire new customers compared to retaining existing ones. By understanding the reasons behind customer churn and implementing strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, companies can work towards reducing churn and increasing customer lifetime value.

In this project, I will analyze customer churn using SQL and visualize the results using Power BI.
The data set includes information about:

- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

- Demographic information about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
