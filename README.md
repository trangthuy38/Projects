- Customer churn rate refers to the percentage of customers or subscribers who discontinue their relationship with a company over a specific period of time. It is a metric commonly used in business to measure customer retention and gauge the effectiveness of customer relationship management strategies.

- Churn Rate = (Customers Lost / Total Customers at the Start of the Period) * 100

- Monitoring and reducing churn rate is important for businesses as it can be costly to acquire new customers compared to retaining existing ones. By understanding the reasons behind customer churn and implementing strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, companies can work towards reducing churn and increasing customer lifetime value.
